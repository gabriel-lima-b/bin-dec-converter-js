# Binary to Decimal Converter
The ideia I get from [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas)

This repository contains the binary to decimal converter page I created using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

I made this page to practice my studies with the technologies.

There is a preview [here](https://gabriel-lima-b.github.io/bin-dec-converter-js/)

Thanks for your interest in my project!
